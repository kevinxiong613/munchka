## Summary:
- This a full-stack web app with user authentication/authorization that creates recipes from leftover ingredients with Googleâ€™s Gemini API
- Created a neural network with 97% accurate hand gesture detection, enabling hands-free recipe scrolling while cooking
- Implemented a REST API with Express.js for user authentication and interaction with the Google Gemini API
- Utilized Python to create a web socket server so that the client side can send images for the neural network to process, and returns a response indicating which direction (if any) to scroll
